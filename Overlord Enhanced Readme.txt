The power of Ainz Ooal Gown is a double-edge knife.

Warning:
This class is an edited version of an existing one on the workshop. He is powerful compared to vanilla heroes. If you are the first time playing vanilla Darkest Dungeon or thinking highly of balance, better not abuse his power too often.

Overlord Enhanced
Based on "Overlord class mod" made by Hinak.
If you like this class, please also rate the vanilla version, thank you!

Note:
This mod shares same ID of vanilla version "Overlord class mod". Don't enable both at the same time, and better not switch between them when your save file is in dungeons (do it when you currently in the town), otherwise there might be some skill bugs unless you return to the town.

Spell Scroll & Cash Shop Item
- New item system of spell scrolls provided when embark and when using certain camping skill.
- Scroll list: Create Moderate Undead, Mass Delay Teleportation, Body of Effulgent Beryl, Freedom of Movement, Indomitability, Triplet Maximize Magic.
- Using spell scrolls will cause the caster suffer resolve XP penalty for the entire quest.
- Resolve XP penalty can be neutralized by using the trinket "Avarice & Generosity" wisely.
- New item system of counterfeits (or called: cash shop items) provided by certain camping skill.
- Counterfeits are actually one-use consumable counterfeits of corresponding Nazarick trinkets which is weakened (don't have their unique effects) and lasts only for one battle.
- Using counterfeits will cause the user suffer stress penalty for one battle.
- Overlord himself is always free from resolve XP and stress penalty caused by spell scrolls or counterfeits.

Trinkets
- All high rarity trinkets are now unique and useable by any class except the crystal and pet trinket, also they have special effects according to the Anime/Novel of Overlord.
- Equip two trinkets of the same "Nazarick Relic" or "World Item" type at one time will suffer stress penalty as mortals cannot handle such great power.

Aura of Horror Passive
- When casting spells except Time Stop and doing non-crits (or if the spell can't crit at all), every other hero suffers permanent dot stress for 1 pt/rd. It can stack infinitely, can be dispelled, lasts until battle end, or until affected hero is afflicted.

Necromancy Spell Passive
- Grasp Heart & Cry of the Banshee can no longer harm certain monster types such as unholy & cauldron since they are not alive. (Necromancy Metamagic will partially ignore this restriction)

Undead Passive
- In town can only gamble or meditate for stress relief.
- Food Unnecessary: no food consumption, no heal from food, immune to starve damage & starve stress.
- Emotional Supression: immune to siren's song, immune to stress heal If virtued, maximum stress resist if afflicted (default -80% Stress).
- Disease Immunity: immune to disease and crimson curse.
- Holy Water Weakness: suffer damage and penalty when using holy water.

About Overhaul:
- Most enhanced designs are based on "double-edge knife" thus more or less making it paid for a price, while trying to simulate descriptions in the Anime/Novel of Overlord.
- Emotional Supression doesn't mean Overlord could completely ignore stress. He will still be over-stressed, even cannot be stress healed when virtued. The only advantage is he will be very difficult to reach heart attack when afflicted, reasonable for an undead.
- Since the scrolls occupy many inventory slots, it's highly recommended to use some "larger inventory" mods when playing this mod, or just treat it as another price for power.

About Global Rules:
The global rule "stress_dmg_buff_min" affect entire game, so I CANNOT adjust it imprudently. This rule cause stress resist can only stack to -80%. So "max stress resist" listed in "Emotional Supression" and "Indomitability" means only -80% stress, NOT -100% stress.
